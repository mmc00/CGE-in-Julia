# CGE-in-Julia
Completed in partial fulfillment of ER290A: Computational Methods in Economics 

This repository will contain a simple CGE model in julia based on an EcoMod (Global Economic Modeling Network) CGE training model. The model represents a two-sector economy with two firms and one household that maximize profits and utility according to a CES production function and a LES utility function, respectively.  The model is solved using the JuMP package in place of the GAMS non-linear programming solver.
